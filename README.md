ascii-video

A Python program which takes live video from your webcam and displays an ASCII-fied version.

To install the dependencies first install pipenv, then run 'pipenv install' from
inside the directory with the program.
The program can then be used with 'pipenv run python ascii-video.py' (may need to use python3 depending on system).

Note: this is still a work in progress. In particular, there is no testing.
